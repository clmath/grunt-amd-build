# amdshim

amdshim is a tasks ordering the shims included in a layer so they are executed in the right order.
It takes a list of shims generated by the amddepsscan task, sort it and include their dependencies as well as
making the content of the layer understandable to requirejs.

### amdshim (layerName, buildConfig, loaderConfig)

_This task should be run after amddepsscan_

Takes a list of shim to include from amddepsscan and order them. You can exclude shims by specifying them in the exclude
property as explain in amddepsscan documentation but if a shim is included in the layer, all of its dependencies will be
included too.
This is to avoid timing issues as shims are executed as soon as they are loaded.

This task should be used when you want to include shims in your layer.

#### Arguments
1. layerName _(String)_: The layer name.
1. buildConfig _(String)_: Name of the property where the build configuration is stored.
1. loaderConfig _(String)_: Name of the property where the amd loader configuration is stored.
	For this task, loaderConfig is only used to look up the shims.
